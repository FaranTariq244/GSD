## Learnings
(patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - Set up project structure
- Created monorepo using npm workspaces with packages/backend and packages/frontend
- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript + Express with basic health endpoint
- Frontend: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript (scaffolded with create-vite)
- Files changed:
  - Root: package.json (workspace config), .gitignore, README.md, PRD.md (added task checklist)
  - Backend: package.json, tsconfig.json, src/index.ts
  - Frontend: All Vite scaffolded files (updated package.json name to @gsd/frontend)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Project uses npm workspaces for monorepo structure
  - Backend runs on port 3000 by default
  - Frontend runs on port 5173 (Vite default)
  - Test command returns exit 0 for now (no tests yet)
  - Typecheck uses `tsc --noEmit` across both packages
  - PRD.md now has task checklist at the top (added in this iteration)
