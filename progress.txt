## Learnings
- Database: PostgreSQL with pg client library
- Migration pattern: Custom SQL migration runner in src/migrate.ts
- Database connection: Pool exported as default from src/db.ts, configured via environment variables
- Migration files stored in packages/backend/migrations/ as .sql files

  - Drop position calculation: Compare e.clientY to element midpoint (getBoundingClientRect) to determine above/below
  - Drop indicator pattern: Blue 3px line with pulse animation (opacity 0.8 to 0.4) for visual feedback
  - State management: Use dropTarget state {column, position} to track where indicator should appear
  - Event handling: Use stopPropagation on task drag events to prevent column handlers from interfering
  - Position index: Find task index in sorted column tasks, use index for drop-above or index+1 for drop-below
  - Clean up: Reset dropTarget state in handleDragEnd and after successful drop
  - Backend already handles reordering logic in POST /tasks/:id/move endpoint (no backend changes needed)
  - Visual pattern: Wrap TaskCard in div to conditionally render drop indicator before the card
  - End-of-column drop: Show indicator after last task when dropTarget.position === columnTasks.length

  - HTTP status codes: 204 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors
  - Access verification uses same JOIN pattern as GET /attachments/:id (attachments -> tasks -> boards -> account_members)
  - Query only fetches id and storage_key (minimal fields needed for deletion)
  - deleteFile function from storage.ts uses DeleteObjectCommand from AWS SDK
  - No transaction needed: S3 deletion first, then DB deletion (S3 has no rollback)

## Iteration 23 - Build attachments UI with image previews
- Created GET /tasks/:id/attachments endpoint to list all attachments for a task with presigned download URLs
- Integrated attachments display into TaskDetailModal component with image preview grid
- Added file upload functionality with drag-and-drop file input
- Implemented attachment deletion with confirmation dialog
- Created responsive attachments grid with hover overlays for images
- Added support for both image attachments (with previews) and file attachments (with file info)
- Files changed:
  - packages/backend/src/routes/attachments.ts (added GET /tasks/:id/attachments endpoint)
  - packages/frontend/src/components/TaskDetailModal.tsx (added Attachment interface, attachment state, fetch/upload/delete handlers, attachments UI)
  - packages/frontend/src/components/TaskDetailModal.css (added attachment grid, image preview, overlay, and file display styles)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - GET /tasks/:id/attachments pattern: Fetch all attachments with uploader info, generate presigned URLs for each
  - Attachments UI uses grid layout with auto-fill minmax(200px, 1fr) for responsive display
  - Image attachments: Display as 16:9 aspect ratio preview with hover overlay showing View/Delete actions
  - File attachments: Display with file icon, name, size, and Download/Delete actions
  - File upload pattern: Hidden file input triggered by button click, FormData upload to multipart endpoint
  - Attachment deletion: Confirm dialog before DELETE request, then filter out from local state
  - isImage helper: Check mime_type starts with 'image/' to determine preview type
  - formatFileSize helper: Display bytes as B, KB, or MB with appropriate decimal places
  - Presigned URLs: Generated on backend for each attachment, valid for 1 hour, used for img src and download links
  - Attachment grid hover effects: Image overlay with gradient background, opacity transition on hover
  - File input ref pattern: useRef for file input, trigger click programmatically, reset value after upload

## Iteration 24 - Implement image thumbnail generation
- Installed sharp package for image processing (200px width thumbnails)
- Added generateThumbnail function to storage.ts that resizes images to 200px width with aspect ratio preservation
- Updated POST /tasks/:id/attachments endpoint to generate and upload thumbnails for image files
- Updated GET /tasks/:id/attachments endpoint to include thumbnail_url field with presigned URLs
- Updated GET /attachments/:id endpoint to include thumbnail_url in response
- Updated DELETE /attachments/:id endpoint to delete both original file and thumbnail from storage
- Updated frontend Attachment interface to include thumbnail_url field
- Updated frontend image rendering to use thumbnail_url when available (fallback to download_url)
- Files changed:
  - packages/backend/package.json (added sharp dependency)
  - packages/backend/src/storage.ts (imported sharp, added generateThumbnail function)
  - packages/backend/src/routes/attachments.ts (generate/upload thumbnails on POST, return thumbnail URLs on GET, delete thumbnails on DELETE)
  - packages/frontend/src/components/TaskDetailModal.tsx (added thumbnail_url to Attachment interface, use thumbnail for image preview)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Sharp library: Fast image processing for Node.js, works well with buffers (resize, convert format, compress)
  - Thumbnail generation: 200px width with aspect ratio preservation using fit: 'inside' and withoutEnlargement: true
  - Thumbnail format: Convert all images to JPEG with quality 80 for consistent format and smaller file size
  - Thumbnail storage key pattern: Add 'thumb-' prefix to original storage key for easy identification
  - Thumbnail generation is conditional: Only generate for image MIME types (mime_type.startsWith('image/'))
  - Frontend pattern: Use thumbnail_url || download_url as fallback for images without thumbnails
  - Delete pattern: Delete thumbnail from storage before deleting DB record (same as original file)
  - Presigned URLs: Generated for both original files and thumbnails, valid for 1 hour
  - Performance: Thumbnails reduce bandwidth usage for image previews in UI (200px vs full resolution)

## Iteration 25 - Implement search by title filter
- Added search by title filter to Board component
- Created search input in board topbar that filters tasks by title using backend API
- Modified fetchTasks to accept search query parameter and append to API URL
- Added useEffect dependency on searchQuery to refetch tasks when search changes
- Files changed:
  - packages/frontend/src/components/Board.tsx (added searchQuery state, modified fetchTasks, added search input UI)
  - packages/frontend/src/components/Board.css (added board-topbar and search-input styles)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Search pattern: Use controlled input with state, debounce by using useEffect with searchQuery dependency
  - Backend already supports search parameter: GET /tasks?search=query uses ILIKE for case-insensitive title search
  - URLSearchParams: Clean pattern for building query strings with conditional parameters
  - Search UI placement: Topbar above columns with max-width 400px for search input
  - Board layout: Changed to flex column layout to accommodate topbar + columns
  - Search input styling: Focus state with blue border and subtle shadow for better UX
  - No debouncing implemented yet - fires on every keystroke (could be optimized with useDebounce hook if needed)
  - Search is live: Results update immediately as user types
---

## Iteration 26 - Implement filter by assignee
- Added assignee filter dropdown to Board component topbar
- Fetches list of account members using existing GET /account/members endpoint
- Added Member interface and members state to Board component
- Updated fetchTasks to include assignee query parameter when filter is selected
- Added useEffect dependency on assigneeFilter to refetch tasks when filter changes
- Files changed:
  - packages/frontend/src/components/Board.tsx (added Member interface, assigneeFilter state, members state, fetchMembers function, updated fetchTasks, added assignee dropdown)
  - packages/frontend/src/components/Board.css (added assignee-filter styles with hover and focus states)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Assignee filter pattern: Fetch members on mount, store in state, populate dropdown options
  - Backend already supports assignee parameter: GET /tasks?assignee=userId uses EXISTS subquery on task_assignees table
  - Filter dropdown UI: Use select element with "All Assignees" default option, show member names
  - Multiple filters: URLSearchParams cleanly handles multiple query parameters (search + assignee)
  - Dropdown styling: Match search input styling for consistency (border, padding, focus states)
  - Member fetching: Use separate useEffect with empty dependency array to fetch once on mount
  - Filter state: Empty string ('') means no filter, user ID string means filter by that user
  - Board topbar layout: Flex with gap, search input grows (flex: 1, max-width), dropdown has fixed min-width
